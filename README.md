# Skywars

For Minecraft servers from version 1.8 to 1.12 (I plan to add support to more versions in the future)

## How to install

To install the plugin, drag the .jar file to your server's **plugins** folder.\
The plugin does not need any other dependencies as it should work by itself.\
You can start the server after installing the plugin.

## How to use

Type **/sw help** to see the available commands.\
The plugin comes with a default arena and kit,\
so you should be able to play right after installing the plugin.

### How to play

Type **/sw play** to open the arenas menu and click an arena to join.\
Type **/sw start** to start the game countdown.\
Type **/sw forcestart** to start the game immediately.

### Creating an arena

To create an arena, type **/sw create <arena>**\
After creating the arena, type **/sw config <arena>** to open the configuration menu\
You can configurate most of the values of the arena on the configuration menu\
Make sure to select an **schematic** file\
To load an schematic file, put it inside the **schematics** folder inside the plugin folder\
You can set the arena's schematic through the configuration menu

### Creating signs

To create a sign, make it like this:
